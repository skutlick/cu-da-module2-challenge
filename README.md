Module 2 Challenge for Bootcamp: CU-VIRT-DATA-PT-04-2024-U-LOLC-MWTH

For this challenge, I am submitting a total of 7 files:  
  1) Excel Macro-Enabled Worksheet with a successful run of the TickerStats() macro within Module1
  2) Raw TickerStats.bas file that represents the full VBA code used to complete the assignment
  3) Four separate screenshots showing high-level detail for each quarter's data
  4) This README file

To assist me in completing this challenge, I consulted with a co-worker to completed a similar type of course back in 2020.  Additionally, I discussed my approach to the VBA code with other students within my cohort.
